    <h1>Negotiation Toolkit</h1>

    <p>The NegotiationToolkit is a set of servlets that can be used to test SPNEGO.</p>

    <h3>Basic Negotiation</h3>
    <p> 
      The Basic Negotiation servlet is a servlet that will attempt the initial
      stages of negotiation with the client browser.<br>
      
      The purpose of this servlet is to verify that the client browser does
      respond with a SPNEGO token and displays the contents of the token.<br>
      <a href="BasicNegotiation">Basic Negotiation</a> 
    </p>

    <h3>NTLM Negotiation</h3>
    <p> 
      The NTLM Negotiation servlet specifically prompts the browser for 
      NTLM negotiation.<br>
      
      Generally the output of the Basic Negotiation servlet is of more interest
      as SPNEGO should be the preferred negotiation mechanism, however NTLM may
      be considered an acceptable fallback.<br>
      
      If the Basic Negotiation servlet it will forward the request to this servlet 
      to display the output.<br>

    <h3>Security Domain Test</h3>
    <p> 
      The Security Domain Test servlet is a servlet that will prompt you for the
      name of the security domain the server is using to authenticate itself
      and will then attempt the authentication.<br>
      
      This servlet will display the results of the authentication.<br>
      
      The purpose of this servlet is to verify the server can authenticate
      without needing a full SPNEGO request from a client.<br>

    <h3>Secured</h3>
    <p>

      This servlet will display the users principal and the users roles.<br>
      
      The purpose of this servlet is to test the final stage of configuration
      to verify that SPNEGO authentication is working.<br>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
      This chapter describes the steps required to configure the
      authenticator which are specific to Windows, these instructions
      are prepared against Windows 2003.
    </para>

    <para>
      The Windows 2003 machine hosting the user accounts is required to
      be an Active Directory domain controller - having a Windows
      machine with accounts managed locally is not sufficient.
    </para>

    <section>
      <title>Windows 2003 Support Tools</title>

      <para>
        A couple of additional command line utilities are going to be
        required when configuring the service accounts on the domain
        controller, these can be downloaded directly from Microsoft

    <title>Server User Creation</title>

    <para>
      First the server requires a user account to be created for it
      within the domain, this needs to be a normal user account and not
      a computer account - we will perform some additional steps later
      to map the user account to a service account.
    </para>

    <para>
      As we are going to be referring to the server using the name
      'testserver.kerberos.jboss.org' we will create a user called
      'testserver'.
    </para>

    <warning>
      <para>
        It is important to set a valid password on the account as soon
        as you create as changing the password later can invalidate the
        keytab that you export which would break your JBoss
        installations.
      </para>
    </warning>

    <para>The first step is to create the actual user.</para>

      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>
      Set the password for the new user and ensure both 'User cannot
      change password' and 'Password never expires' are set.
    </para>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>
      Next you will need to open the properties dialog for the user to
      make one more change to make the account suitable as a service
      account.
    </para>

      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>
      It is important to ensure that 'Do not require Kerberos
      preauthentication' is checked, occasionally it is also required to
      check 'Use DES encryption types for this account' but recent
      testing has not required this.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        Some of the domain details are slightly different in these
        images as the test domain I am using is slightly different to
        the domain I am using in the examples in this document.
      </para>

    <title>Service Account Mapping</title>

    <para>
      After the user account has been created it needs to be mapped to a
      host account using the setspn.exe and ktpass.exe command line
      utilities included in the Windows 2003 Support Tools.
    </para>

    <para>
      The first utility to use is the setspn.exe utility installed with
      the Windows 2003 support tools. Documentation for this tool is
      available from Microsoft
      <ulink
        url="http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/b3a029a1-7ff0-4f6f-87d2-f2e70294a5761033.mspx?mfr=true">

      </ulink>
    </para>

    <para>
      You should execute the following two command to map the testserver
      user to the correct service principals.
    </para>
     
    <programlisting>
<![CDATA[setspn.exe -a host/testserver.kerberos.jboss.org testserver
setspn.exe -a HTTP/testserver.kerberos.jboss.org testserver]]>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>
      The following command then can be used to list the mappings.
    </para>

    <programlisting>
      <![CDATA[setspn.exe -l testserver]]></programlisting>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>
      The next step is to use the ktpass.exe utility from the Windows
      2003 support tools and also the ktab.exe tool from the Java
      installation to export the keytab.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        This section needs some further consideration, it may be
        possible to just use one of the commands.
      </para>
    </note>

    <para>
      The ktpass.exe command line utility takes the user created earlier
      and maps it as a trusted host, in this case you would need to
      execute the following command: -
    </para>

    <programlisting>
      <![CDATA[ktpass -princ host/testserver@kerberos.jboss.org -pass * -mapuser KERBEROS\testserver 
-out C:\testserver.host.keytab]]></programlisting>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>
      The ktab.exe utility is then used to export the keytab that will
      be used by the application server using the following command.
    </para>

    <programlisting>
      <![CDATA[ktab -k c:\testserver.host.keytab -a testserver@KERBEROS.JBOSS.ORG]]></programlisting>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>
      The resulting keytab should then be used in setting up the host
      security domain as described in
      <xref linkend="host_security_domain" />
      .
    </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Role Mapping</title>

    <para>
      Finally you will need to configure a second login module in the
      application-policy to load the associate roles with the user.
    </para>

    <para>
      You could make use of the UsersRolesLoginModule as described in
      <xref linkend="users_roles_login_module" />
      or you can make use of a new LDAP login module to load the roles
      directly from Active Directory, an example of think login module
      is documented in
      <xref linkend="ad_chained_configuration" />
    </para>
